# Unit 21: Martian Token Crowdsale

![alt=""](Images/application-image.png)

## Background

After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected us to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose us to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. We decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. We shall launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
